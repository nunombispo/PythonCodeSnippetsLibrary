import math


def find_gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)


# Example usage
print(find_gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6

# Why?
# This snippet quickly finds the GCD of two numbers using Pythonâ€™s built-in math.gcd function.
# It's useful in mathematical computations, simplifying fractions, and solving algorithmic problems efficiently.
