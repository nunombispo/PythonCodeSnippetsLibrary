# Example usage
card = "4539 1488 0343 6467"
print(validate_credit_card(card))  # Output: True (if the card number is valid)


# Why?
# This snippet implements the Luhn algorithm, a common checksum formula used to validate credit card numbers and
# other identification numbers.
# Itâ€™s a practical tool for payment processing systems, fraud detection, and any application that requires input
# validation for numerical identifiers.
