# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Generate and save a key (do this once)
    key = generate_key()
    save_key(key)

    # Load the key for encryption/decryption
    key = load_key()

    # Encrypt a file
    encrypt_file("plain.txt", "encrypted.txt", key)

    # Decrypt the file
    decrypt_file("encrypted.txt", "decrypted.txt", key)


# Why?
# This snippet uses Python's cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt files using the Fernet
# symmetric encryption.
# Itâ€™s essential for protecting sensitive data, secure file storage, and can be easily integrated
# into larger security-focused applications.
